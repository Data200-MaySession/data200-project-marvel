## **2\. Problem Statement**

Employee turnover is a critical challenge facing modern organizations, with the average cost of replacing an employee ranging from 50% to 200% of their annual salary. High attrition rates not only result in direct costs related to recruitment, training, and onboarding but also lead to indirect costs such as decreased productivity, loss of institutional knowledge, and reduced team morale.

**Primary Research Question**: What workplace and demographic factors are the strongest predictors of employee attrition, and can we develop a reliable statistical model to identify employees at high risk of leaving?

**Business Objectives**:

* Identify the most significant factors contributing to employee turnover  
* Develop a predictive model to assess individual employee attrition risk  
* Provide actionable insights for HR departments to implement targeted retention strategies  
* Create a decision support tool to help managers proactively address retention issues

**Expected Impact**: Enable organizations to reduce turnover costs by 15-30% through data-driven retention strategies and early intervention programs.

## **4\. Brief Description of the Chosen Model**

**Logistic Regression \- Primary Model**

**Why Logistic Regression is Appropriate**: Logistic regression is the optimal choice for this employee attrition prediction problem because:

* **Binary Outcome**: Attrition is a binary dependent variable (employee leaves or stays)  
* **Probability Estimation**: Provides probability scores (0-1) for attrition risk, enabling risk categorization  
* **Interpretability**: Coefficients can be converted to odds ratios, showing how each factor increases/decreases attrition likelihood  
* **Multiple Predictors**: Can handle multiple independent variables simultaneously (age, salary, satisfaction, overtime, etc.)  
* **Robust Performance**: Well-established method for classification problems in business analytics

**Model Specification**:

logit(P(Attrition \= Yes)) \= β₀ \+ β₁(Age) \+ β₂(MonthlyIncome) \+ β₃(JobSatisfaction) \+   
                           β₄(OverTime) \+ β₅(WorkLifeBalance) \+ β₆(YearsAtCompany) \+   
                           β₇(DistanceFromHome) \+ ... \+ εᵢ

**Key Model Features**:

* **Input Variables**: Employee demographics, job characteristics, compensation, and satisfaction metrics  
* **Output**: Probability of attrition (0-100%) and risk classification (Low/Medium/High)  
* **Validation**: Model accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curve analysis  
* **Business Application**: Risk scoring system for HR decision-making

**Supporting Statistical Analyses**:

* **ANOVA**: Compare job satisfaction scores across departments to identify organizational pain points  
* **Linear Regression**: Examine salary-satisfaction relationships to inform compensation strategies  
* **Descriptive Analysis**: Profile high-risk employee segments for targeted interventions

**Expected Model Performance**:

* Target accuracy: 75-85% (typical for HR analytics)  
* Focus on minimizing false negatives (missing at-risk employees)  
* Emphasis on actionable insights rather than perfect prediction

This comprehensive statistical approach will provide both predictive capabilities and deep insights into the underlying factors driving employee turnover, enabling data-driven HR decision-making.
